## 6. Why It's Specifically Designed for Individuals with ADHD

MementoAI isn't just a productivity tool that happens to be useful for people with ADHD - it's specifically engineered to address the unique cognitive patterns and challenges associated with ADHD:

### Cognitive Flexibility Over Rigid Structure
Traditional productivity tools often fail for individuals with ADHD because they require rigid adherence to predetermined systems. MementoAI embraces cognitive flexibility by allowing users to interact naturally, adapting to their communication style rather than forcing them into a predefined mold.

### Reducing Cognitive Load
People with ADHD often experience cognitive overload, making it difficult to manage multiple systems for different types of information. MementoAI consolidates task management, scheduling, contact information, and reminders into a single conversational interface, reducing the mental effort required to stay organized.

### Working with Impulse Control Challenges
Rather than fighting against the tendency to switch tasks frequently, MementoAI supports seamless transitions while maintaining context. The system remembers where users left off and can easily help them return to interrupted tasks without losing momentum.

### Accommodating Variable Performance
ADHD is characterized by inconsistent performance - some days are better than others. MementoAI provides support that scales with user needs, offering gentle reminders on difficult days and staying out of the way when users are functioning well.

### Leveraging Hyperfocus
When individuals with ADHD experience hyperfocus, they can be extremely productive on topics of interest. MementoAI supports this by providing a distraction-free interface that can capture ideas and tasks without interrupting the flow state.

### Addressing Time Perception Issues
Many people with ADHD struggle with time blindness - difficulty estimating how long tasks will take or remembering commitments. MementoAI helps by automatically tracking time context and providing reminders that account for these challenges.

### Supporting Executive Function Weaknesses
Rather than expecting users to provide all organizational effort themselves, MementoAI actively assists with planning, prioritization, and task breakdown - the very executive functions that are typically challenging for individuals with ADHD.

### Reducing Shame and Judgment
The conversational interface creates a non-judgmental interaction that doesn't highlight organizational failures or create additional stress. Users can interact with MementoAI without feeling "wrong" for not being able to use traditional systems effectively.

### Embracing Neurodiversity
MementoAI is built on the principle that ADHD brains work differently, not deficiently. The system is designed to complement ADHD strengths like creativity, problem-solving, and big-picture thinking while providing support for areas of challenge.

By specifically addressing these ADHD-related needs, MementoAI provides more effective support than generic productivity tools that require users to adapt to their limitations rather than designing for neurodiverse cognitive patterns.

## 7. Code Structure and Architecture
