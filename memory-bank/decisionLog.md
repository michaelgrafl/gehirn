## Decision

Redesigned the settings form from index_legacy.html to integrate with the current design system in index.html using Tailwind CSS.

## Rationale 

The legacy settings form used a different styling approach than the current design system. To maintain consistency across the application and follow modern UI/UX best practices, the settings form needed to be redesigned to match the Tailwind CSS-based design system used in index.html.

## Implementation Details

- Created a new settings modal using Tailwind CSS classes
- Used consistent color scheme from the design system (bg-[#15191e], bg-[#2c343f], etc.)
- Implemented responsive layout with appropriate breakpoints
- Added accessibility features including proper labels and focus states
- Improved visual hierarchy with section headings and consistent spacing
- Grouped related controls together for better organization

[2025-08-04 20:46:00] - Implemented JavaScript functionality to display the settings modal. Added event listeners for showing/hiding the modal and updated the UI.js functions to work with the "hidden" class approach.
